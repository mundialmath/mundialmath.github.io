# About

This is a minimalist web seed that references the most commonly used
packages like [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) for web development. This seed
is mostly based on the [AngularJS seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed)
but includes some new features:

* A source and build folders were created to divide the source form the published web-page.
* The package [sass](http://sass-lang.com/) is included. 
* The [gulpjs](http://gulpjs.com/) package was added to perform some tasks like compiling scss scripts and minifying css, js, html.


# Run
To run this seed, you must run the following code in a nodejs command prompt:
```
npm start
```


# Known errors

If it fails to start with error in package sass, then execute next line
```
npm rebuild node-sass
* * * CAMBIO * * *
```
